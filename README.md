## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This helped me to understanding flexbox well and my solution kinda far from the exactly spot-on for this challange.

### Continued development

I realize that this challange can be solved with grid, but i feel i can't implemented grid as well now.
So i'd learn css grid for layouting.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This official docs help me alot to use tailwindcss.
